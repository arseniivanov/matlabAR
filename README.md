# matlabAR
Simple augmented reality done in MATLAB

Augmented.MP4 - Demonstrational video of result

blackbook.MP4 - Video to apply augmented reality to

cameraMotionAutomatic.m - Automatic detection of binary object using cMinMax-algorithm

checkerAbove.jpg - Photo for calibration of KLT-tracker

decompHomography.XXX - C++-wrapper to decompose homography into Rotation, translation and normal vector of surface

food.jpg - image to insert into scene, can be switched out to arbitrary image

homographyPlacement.m - Simplest form of AR done with homography by choosing 4 points in scene

homographyAutomaticKLT.m - NOT WORKING PROPERLY. Issue with corner point ambiguity causes homography to freak out 

imchecker.jpg - Photo for calibration of KLT-tracker once video is too different from checkerAbove.jpg to detect similarity
